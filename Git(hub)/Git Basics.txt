Git is a software for tracking changes in any set of files. It allows us to create versions of our code, which can be shared
to other programmers, and used as backups to revert to if anything goes wrong. At the core of git is the repository, which 
is where changes in the code are commited. To create a new repository, navigate to the root directory of your project in the
command line, and type "git init" (make sure that git has been installed and added to the PATH).

Once you have made and saved changes to your files, you need to make sure that they are being tracked by Git. To see what 
files are currently tracked, type "git status" on the command line in the same directory as your repository. To add files to
tracking, type "git add filename1 filename2 filename3...", or to add them all at once type "git add *". You can add files in 
a subdirectory of your root folder by typing "git add subdirectory/filname" or "git add subdirectory/*". Once files have been 
added to tracking, they do not need to be re added. 

Confirm that all of your tracked files with changes and new files are ready to be commited by typing "git status". To commit 
your changes to the repository, type "git commit -a -m "message"". Your commit message should be a short, concise description 
of the changes made. Remember to commit regularly; commits should be made everytime a feature/fix is done, so that they are 
organized in case you need to use them as a backup.
